            Have you ever thought about buying a house and considered the climate of the region? Or worried about 
            rent increases or the next natural disaster lurking around the corner? We’ve all been there.  

            Imagine having a tool that provides insights into the shifting perspectives about climate change and its 
            relationship with the housing market. Climate change has a major impact on the housing market, such as 
            increasing insurance rates, making some homes unsustainable due to natural disasters, and causing 
            financial distress for borrowers.  

            Talk to our chatbot to learn more about Reddit's opinion on climate change from 2010-2022!
